Hi, I'm Jamie Culver! I'm a Data Analyst based in the Des Moines area. I've always enjoyed playing the "data detective" role and I love tackling difficult problems. I'm a recent graduate from the Des Moines Area Community College with a certificate in Data Science. Check out my portfolio and personal projects [here.] (https://culverjamie.github.io/culverjamie/)

I'm currently working in the service industry and I'm open to work! On-site in central Iowa and remote work.
